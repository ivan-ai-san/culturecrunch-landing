# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: November 11, 2025**

At Culture Crunch, we believe privacy starts with minimalism. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our leadership development platform at https://culturecrunch.io. We've designed our system around a core principle: collect only what matters, at the team level, to power leadership transformation without compromising individual privacy.

Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not access our platform or use our services.

## Our Privacy Philosophy: Minimalism by Design

Culture Crunch operates on **team-level data only**. We don't track individual performance scores, personal assessments, or granular behavioural metrics. Chris AI monitors collective team signals (clarity, trust, energy), not individual employee surveillance. This means:

- **No individual performance tracking** – we measure team dynamics, not personal productivity
- **Aggregate insights only** – data rolls up to team level, protecting individual privacy
- **Background monitoring without intrusion** – patterns emerge from team interactions, not personal surveillance
- **You control what you share** – participation in weekly pulses and practices is transparent and voluntary
