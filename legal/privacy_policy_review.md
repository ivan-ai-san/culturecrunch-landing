## ⚠️ GAPS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Legal Compliance)

#### 1. **Add Company Identification**
**Issue:** Privacy Act requires clear identification of the entity collecting data.

**Current:** "CultureCrunch" (brand name only)

**Add:**
```
CultureCrunch Pty Ltd
ABN: [Your ABN]
ACN: [Your ACN]
Registered Address: [Your NSW address]
```

**Why:** APP 1.3 requires clear identification of the organization and how to contact it.

---

#### 2. **Data Breach Notification**
**Issue:** Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme requires specific procedures.

**Current:** Not mentioned

**Add Section:**
```
## Data Breach Notification

If we experience a data breach likely to result in serious harm, we will:
- Notify affected individuals as soon as practicable
- Notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)
- Provide details of the breach, likely consequences, and steps being taken

We maintain an incident response plan in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988.
```

**Why:** Mandatory under NDB scheme since February 2018.

---

#### 3. **Automated Decision-Making Disclosure**
**Issue:** Your "AI Coach Companion" makes recommendations - need to disclose extent of automation.

**Current:** Mentioned in what you collect, but not how AI decisions are made

**Add to existing section:**
```
## How We Use Your Information

### AI-Powered Insights
Our AI Coach Companion analyzes team-level data to provide leadership recommendations. 
These insights are:
- Advisory only (not automated decisions affecting employment)
- Based on aggregated team signals, not individual metrics
- Reviewed by human coaches before critical recommendations
- Always subject to leadership judgment and context

You have the right to understand how AI recommendations are generated and to 
request human review of any AI-generated insight.
```

**Why:** APPs require transparency about automated processing, especially for workplace systems.

---

### Priority 2: RECOMMENDED (Best Practice)

#### 4. **Specify Key Data Processors**
**Current:** "Service providers for cloud hosting, payment processing, email delivery, analytics"

**Improve to:**
```
## Third-Party Service Providers

We use trusted vendors who process data on our behalf:
- **Cloud Hosting:** [e.g., AWS Sydney, Supabase Australia]
- **Payment Processing:** [e.g., Stripe]
- **Email Delivery:** [e.g., Resend, SendGrid]
- **Analytics:** [e.g., Vercel Analytics, PostHog]
- **Customer Support:** [e.g., Intercom, Front]

All processors are contractually bound to protect your data and comply with 
Australian privacy standards.
```

**Why:** Transparency builds trust; shows you've thought about data security.

---

#### 5. **Clarify De-Anonymization Risk**
**Current:** States team-level data only, but doesn't address small team risk

**Add:**
```
## Privacy Protection for Small Teams

For teams with fewer than 5 members, aggregated data may be reasonably 
identifiable to individuals. In these cases:
- We apply additional privacy safeguards
- Leaders receive summary insights only (no granular breakdowns)
- Sensitive signals are suppressed if identifiability risk is high

We will notify you if your team size creates privacy considerations.
```

**Why:** Shows you've thought about edge cases; important for workplace privacy.

---

#### 6. **Workplace Privacy Considerations**
**Current:** Focuses on consumer privacy, but this is a B2B workplace tool

**Add New Section:**
```
## Workplace Privacy Notice

CultureCrunch is designed for workplace use. If you are an employee whose 
organisation uses CultureCrunch:

- **Data Collection:** Your team leader may access team-level insights that 
  include signals from your participation
- **Individual Privacy:** We do NOT share individual responses, scores, or 
  behavioral data with your employer
- **Voluntary Participation:** Consult your organisation's policies regarding 
  participation expectations
- **Complaints:** You may raise concerns with us at privacy@culturecrunch.io 
  or your organisation's privacy officer

Organisational customers are required to notify employees about CultureCrunch 
use in accordance with APP 5 (notification of collection).
```

**Why:** Fair Work Act and APPs have specific requirements for employee monitoring/data collection.

---

#### 7. **Cookie Consent Mechanism**
**Current:** States cookies are used but doesn't mention consent banner

**Add:**
```
When you first visit CultureCrunch, we display a cookie consent banner 
allowing you to accept or customize cookie preferences. You can change 
these preferences anytime through your account settings or browser controls.
```

**Why:** Best practice; aligns with GDPR (if you get EU traffic) and Australian ePrivacy guidelines.

---

#### 8. **Retention Detail for Deleted Accounts**
**Current:** "90 days for transition support" after account closure

**Clarify:**
```
## Data Retention After Account Closure

Upon account deletion:
- **Active Data:** Removed within 90 days to allow transition/export
- **Backup Systems:** Removed within 180 days (due to backup rotation)
- **Legal Holds:** Retained longer only if required by law or legitimate dispute
- **Aggregated Analytics:** De-identified data may be retained indefinitely 
  for research (cannot be re-linked to you)
```

**Why:** More specific = more transparent.

---

### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Competitive Advantage)

#### 9. **Privacy by Design Statement**
You mention "privacy by minimalism" - expand this into a competitive differentiator:

```
## Our Privacy Commitments

Beyond legal compliance, we commit to:
1. **Team-Level Only:** Never tracking individual performance metrics
2. **No Surveillance:** No keystroke logging, screen monitoring, or activity tracking
3. **Leader-Focused:** Data serves leadership development, not performance management
4. **Research Quality:** Contributing to peer-reviewed organizational science
5. **Transparent AI:** Explaining how our AI Coach generates recommendations

These are not just policies—they're core to how CultureCrunch works.
```

---

#### 10. **Industry-Specific Context**
Since you target healthcare, manufacturing, construction:

```
## Industry-Specific Privacy

**Healthcare Clients:** If your organisation is subject to health privacy laws, 
CultureCrunch's team-level approach avoids collecting health information.

**Regulated Industries:** For clients in finance, government, or critical 
infrastructure, we offer additional data residency and security controls. 
Contact sales@culturecrunch.io for details.
```
