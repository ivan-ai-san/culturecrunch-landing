## 2. The Problem Section

### Section Badge
THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH

### Headline
# Four Reasons Your People Aren't Changing
*And why that executive retreat next month won't help*

### The Four Failures

#### 🧠 They Forget 90% in Seven Days
But you already knew that, didn't you?

#### 🎭 They're Faking It
First-order change: New words, same behaviors.

#### ⏰ You're Fighting 43% of Their Day
That's how much of work is automatic habits.

#### 😤 They Never Asked For This
30% success when mandated. 79% when they own it.

### The Money Shot
> **Every failed initiative costs 5X:** Direct costs + opportunity costs + discouragement + change fatigue + cynicism = organizational scar tissue

## 3. The Insight Section

### Section Badge
THE BREAKTHROUGH

### Headline
# What If Leadership Development Ran Like Your Operating System?
*Invisible. Continuous. Essential.*

### The Shift

**FROM:** Annual events → **TO:** Weekly rhythms

**FROM:** Knowledge transfer → **TO:** Behavior installation

**FROM:** HR's program → **TO:** How work gets done

### The Science Drop
#### 66 Days: The Magic Number Nobody Talks About
Median time to behavioral automaticity. Your two-day workshop? Not even close.

#### 95.6%: The Spacing Effect Advantage
Weekly practice beats intensive workshops in 259 of 271 studies.

#### R = MC²: The Readiness Equation
Readiness = Motivation × Capacity². Without it, you're dead before you start.

## 4. The Solution Section

### Section Badge
THE OPERATING SYSTEM

### Headline
# Six Components. Thirty Minutes Weekly. Transformation.

### The System Components

#### 1. Embedded Practice
Stop adding. Start integrating.

#### 2. Psychological Safety
No trust? No change. Period.

#### 3. Micro-Habits
30 seconds beats 30 minutes.

#### 4. Peer Accountability
Your boss can't change you. Your peers can.

#### 5. Real-Time Metrics
Leading indicators predict. Lagging indicators prove.

#### 6. Executive Modeling
They watch what you do, not what you fund.

## 6. O.O.R.A. Methodology

### Section Badge
THE FRAMEWORK

### Headline
# Four Moves. Every Conversation. Total Accountability.

### The O.O.R.A. Method

#### Observation
Facts, not stories.
*"The meeting started at 9. You arrived at 9:15."*

#### Ownership
What's my part?
*"I didn't send a reminder."*

#### Request
Choice, not compliance.
*"Would you be willing to..."*

#### Agreement
Mutual commitment.
*"So we're both agreeing to..."*

### The Research
> Teams using O.O.R.A.: **79% implementation success**
> Teams using mandates: **30% implementation success**
