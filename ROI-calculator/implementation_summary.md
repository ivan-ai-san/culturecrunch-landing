### Calculation Categories (5 Benefits)

**1. Turnover Reduction** (Largest benefit - 35-40% of total)
- Research: 25-40% reduction with good leadership (Deloitte, ICF, Zenger Folkman)
- Calculator uses: 25% (conservative)
- Example: 500 employees, 15% turnover, $75k salary = $527k Year 1, $1.4M Year 2+

**2. Productivity Gains** (Second largest - 30-35% of total)
- Research: 10% improvement (ICF, DDI)
- Mechanism: Better habits, clearer goals, reduced friction
- Example: $37.5M compensation × 50% sensitive × 10% = $1.875M/year full implementation

**3. Engagement Improvements** (15-20% of total)
- Research: 7-23% improvement reduces presenteeism (Gallup, McKinsey, BCG)
- Calculator uses: 7% (conservative)
- Example: 37% presenteeism cost × 7% recovery = $971k/year

**4. Error/Quality Reduction** (5-10% of total, industry-specific)
- Research: Leadership influences 15-25% of error variance (Jeyaraman healthcare meta-analysis)
- Industry rates: Healthcare 5%, Manufacturing 8%, Tech 3%, Professional Services 4%
- Example: Tech with 3% error rate × 15% leadership influence = $169k/year

**5. Communication/Time Savings** (5-10% of total)
- Research: O.O.R.A. methodology improves communication efficiency 30%
- Mechanism: 25% of manager time on communication issues
- Example: $5.6M manager compensation × 25% × 30% = $422k/year
